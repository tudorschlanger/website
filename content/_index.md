subheading: A few words about myself 
text1: I am a predoctoral fellow at Princeton University working with Professor Atif Mian on research at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Bank of Canada where I worked in the Model Development division of the Canadian Economic Analysis department. 
text2: I am passionate about macroeconomics, public policy and economic ideas with potentially great social impact, and I am interested in the art of modelling to understand fundamental dynamics in the economy. 
text3: One of the reasons behind creating this website was to post about my interests, thoughts and ideas on a diverse array of topics, all united by a common economic flavour. I invite you to go to my blog and engage with these ideas in the comments section below the posts, or even share them!
