**Sequencing Extended Monetary Policies at the Effective Lower Bound**
[Paper](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sdp2021-10.pdf) |
Abstract: In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of Canada aggressively lowered its policy interest rate and provided additional easing using forward guidance and quantitative easing. In this analysis, we use simulations in the Bank of Canada's projection model-the Terms-of-Trade Economic Model-to consider a suite of extended monetary policies (EMPs) to support the economy following the COVID-19 crisis. We focus on the implementation sequencing of three EMP options when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound: credit easing, forward guidance and quantitative easing.
